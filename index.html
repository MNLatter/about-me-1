      My name is Regan Hayes. I usually go by 'Chanel' or my nickname 'Rae'. I am originally from Virginia but currently I live in New Jersey. I am 23 years old. Fun fact: I graduated from high school early. I entered the military straight out of high school. In the military, my job was Civil Engineering. I stayed in the military for 3.5 years and I was medically discharged. After the military, I worked on base as a civilian for a year. After that, I moved back to Virginia and worked at the shipyard for a few months. it was a great job but I met my fiance and decided to move back to New Jersey. After a few busted jobs, I decided to start my career in tech at Code Fellows because I felt I needed a diciplined setting to learn. My goal at Code Fellows is to learning the basics enough to start a career in tech and provide for my family and my daughter.
