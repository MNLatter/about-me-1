      <p>
        My name is Regan Hayes. I usually go by 'Chanel' or my nickname 'Rae'. I am originally from Virginia but currently I live in New Jersey. I am 23 years old. I decided to start my career in tech at Code Fellows because I felt I needed a diciplined setting to learn. My goal at Code Fellows is to learning the basics enough to start a career in tech and provide for my family and my daughter.
